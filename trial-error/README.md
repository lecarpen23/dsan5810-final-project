## Directory Naviagation

Here, we give a brief outline of our `trial-error/` directory to provide for easy navigation.

* `evaluation/`: this directory contains evaluation attempts that were not successful, including those on HELM requiring configuration files, such as `run_specs.conf`. **Note**: this directory also contains local fine-tuned models that we did not end up using in our final workflow, that are also not in the repository due to their size.

* `z_archive/`: this directory is another collection of attempts that we did not use in our final workflow, including more HELM configuration files (`run_specs.conf`) and commands that we attempted on HELM (`helm_commands.txt`).

* `README.md`: this file is, of course, the README file that describes this directory.

* `*.ipynb`: the notebooks in this directory are all attempts that we did not use in our final workflow, including fine-tuning attempts (`finetuning-hf.ipynb`) and model loading attempts (`load_att_3.ipynb`).

* `*.py`: the Python scripts in this directory are all attempts that we did not use in our final workflow, including fine-tuning attempts (`finetuning.py`) and environment testing (`test-env.py`).

* `*.txt`: the text files in this directory are outputs reported by different HELM attempts, including the use of `helm-run` and `helm-summarize` commands.

========== Iteration 4 ==========
PROMPT: answer with one number from the question: Suppose $f(x)$ is a function that has this property: For all real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a<b$, the portion of the graph of $y=f(x)$ between $x=a$ and $x=b$ lies below the line segment whose endpoints are $(a,f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$. (A function with this property is called strictly convex.) Given that $f(x)$ passes through $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$, what is the range of all possible values for $f(1)$? Express your answer in interval notation. 1: (-inf, 10) 2: (-inf, 9) 3: (-inf, 8) 4: (-inf, 7)
